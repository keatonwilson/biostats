##Learning Objectives:  
  1. Students will be able to describe the utility of attributing error/variance to data sets (real-world scenarios) - why error and variance matters (lying with charts).
  
  2. Students will be able to describe different ways of attributing error to data sets (SE, SD, CI, variance) - REAL definition of 95% confidence interval (subtle, but important).
  
  3. Students can use variance and error to make interesting inferences about data (outliers - maybe simpler is better here).  


## 1. Why is quantifying and plotting error important?
