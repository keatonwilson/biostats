# biostats

This project is a repository for the POGIL Biostats course developed by Nicholas DiRienzo, Keaton Wilson and Robbie Zinna in 2017.

## Overview of the course - from Google Docs
 
### Needs layout editing - the language is Markdown. 

##Introductory Biostatistics

Who is it geared for? 300 level - No statistics experience, but bio majors.  

Goal of the Course: Equip undergraduates with the tools to collect and manage data, visualize data, choose and conduct basic statistical tests on their data, using R  
  * Sub Goal- Ensure students have a strong working vocabulary of statistical concepts  
  * Sub Goal- Make a SWIRL course module?   
2x per week - 1.5 hour class length. Open lab possibility?

Textbooks/Recommend: How to Lie with Statistics

## Course Overview
***
####1. Mechanics of R, R studio (other basic biocomputing tools) - SWIRL, GGPLOT? - Nick  [Week 1]

####2. Mechanics of data collection and importing into R - Robbie - [Week 2]

  
a. Make a bunch of different vectors and smash together into data frames in different ways  
b. Object Stuff etc.  

####3. Visualizing Data and Interpretation [Week 3] - Keaton

####4.Learning about different classes of data [Week 4]- NICK

a. Data types, etc [Week 4]
b. Have students collect in-class data (arm length, height, eye/hair color)
c. Learning Objectives
    1. Students will be able to determine the different classes of data - numeric, integer, factor, character
    2. Figure out how R can tell you what class it is
    3. Can assign data classes to different data types - e.g. what is height?
    4. Think of some tricky ones - e.g. what type of data would a DNA sequence be?  
    5. Can plot different types of data - what type for binary, continuous, etc. 
    6. Can relate data types back to plotting info from past week  
    
####5.Descriptive statistics - [Week 5] - Nick
a. Mean, median, mode, range, min max, quantiles?

####6. Variance and error [Week 6] - Keaton
a. Learning Objectives:
    1. Students will be able to describe the utility of attributing error/variance to data sets (real-world scenarios) - why error and variance           matters (lying with charts).  
    2.Students will be able to describe different ways of attributing error to data sets (SE, SD, CI, variance) - REAL definition of 95% confidence       interval (subtle, but important).  
    3.Students can use variance and error to make interesting inferences about data (outliers - maybe simpler is better here).  
    
What is a p-value, limit of just that value, and other measures [Week 7]
LEARNING OUTCOMES:
Students will understand the relationship between p-values and probability
Probability of data, not hypothesis
Students will describe what an alpha value represents
History of alpha=0.05
Students will use the correct language to evaluate a hypothesis using a p-value
Null vs your ACTUAL hypothesis
Students will differentiate between Type I and Type II errors, and describe their relationship to p-values.
Relationship between sample sizes and p-values
Probability (Think about this)
Make into a POGIL about probability?
Data Exploration - Using data to figure out what tests are useful for different data types
Correlation: Pearson, spearman, kendall [Week 8]
Chi squared / fisherâ€™s exact [Week 9]
T test / Anova [Week 10]
Levines test?
Regression (Interactions/logistic if class is going well) [Week 11]

COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Students should be able to import data into R
Conduct basic manipulations of their data
Identify errors in their data
Conduct basic descriptive visualizations and summarizations of their data
Students should be able to recognize different types of data and apply appropriate tests for those data types
Students should be able to identify the limitations of basic statistical tests
Students should be able to critically think about the validity of statistical tests and data presentation in scientific literature and popular material
Students should understand the interrelated nature of P-values, Confidence intervals, and effect sizes
Students should have a strong working vocabulary of statistical concepts
Students should be able to apply the appropriate visualization for their statistical tests

Game Plan for this week:
Resources within R:
Iris Data set (iris) - 4 measures of flower traits (numeric) across three different species (factors).
